A simple actionlib CLI client


How to use
----------

Add this package in your `catkin` workspace, don't forget to
source your `devel/setup.bash` after running `catkin_make`

```shell
axcli <action server> <goal>

Bash should provide TAB-completion of both available action
servers and their associated goals.
